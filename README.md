There is also a drop down menu which displays dog breeds and when one clicks on the breed an image is displayed of the dog. 

One can also post their dog image if they want to and provide the breed name,what it is bred for and the temperament.

### What can the user do
The user can view dog images and if they are amazed they can like the image. They can even add a comment to the photo. They can as well post their own image and even delete it if need arises. 

The app is very user friendly and is easy to use.
